## Datasets

- [BodyHealth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvpanaro/biostats_intro_2023_2024/main/BodyHealth.csv) 
This dataset contains information on 12 individuals' health status (healthy or diseased), disease groups (control, Type A, Type B), nicotine abuse levels (none, low, high), the number of metastases (ranging from 0 upwards), and their body heights (measured in centimeters), enabling research into health-related patterns and correlations.

- [ToothGrowth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvpanaro/biostats_intro_2023_2024/main/ToothGrowth.csv)
  
ToothGrowth {datasets}: The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).

- [neuro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvpanaro/biostats_intro_2023_2024/main/neuro.csv)
  
neuro {boot}: neuro is a matrix containing times of observed firing of a neuron in windows of 250ms either side of the application of a stimulus to a human subject. Each row of the matrix is a replication of the experiment and there were a total of 469 replicates.
